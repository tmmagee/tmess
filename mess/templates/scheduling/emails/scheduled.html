Dear {{ task.member.user.first_name }}, 

Your Mariposa Food Co-op member work shift is scheduled for: 
    Date: {{ task.time|date:"l, F j, Y" }} 
    Time: {{ task.time|date:"g:ia" }} 
    Job: {{ task.job }} 
    Account: {{ task.account }} 

If you cannot work at this time, it is your responsibility to contact
members who work the same shift and attempt to arrange a one-time
shift trade. Go on MESS under the scheduling tab or visit the store to 
collect names, phone numbers, and shift dates of potential other work 
shifters. If you find a match, be sure you know one another's account 
names and the dates/times you are trading. You must let a staff member 
know about the trade so we know who to expect both days.

As a last resort or if you have banked hours you want to use, you may
call the co-op at 215-729-2121 at least 48 hours before your shift. If
you do not have banked hours, you will then need to schedule and work
a makeup.

We'll see you on {{ task.time|date:"l" }}! 

Mariposa Food Co-op
