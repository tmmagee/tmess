Dear {{ task.member.user.first_name }},

This automated email is being sent to you because we recently updated your work shift attendance in MESS based on records provided by your Mariposa committee. Your committee did not receive adequate notice about your inability to complete you monthly shift requirement. Therefore, you were marked unexcused from some or all of your shift requirement.

Please schedule a makeup shift either with your committee or the Membership Coordination Dept.  (Banked hours cannot be used to cover an unexcused shift.) If you believe this email is being sent in error or would like to know where you stand with your hours, please contact membership@mariposa.coop.
 
Please let us know if there are circumstances impacting your ability to complete your workshifts. We appreciate your efforts so please tell us how we can work with you to support your wish to be a working member at Mariposa!

Thank You, 

Membership Coordination Team
