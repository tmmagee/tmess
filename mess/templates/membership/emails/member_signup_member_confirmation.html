PLEASE NOTE: this email is NOT a confirmation that a payment has been received by Mariposa for the equity indicated. Rather it confirms our receipt of your *intent* to pay. You should have completed your payment through PayPal after completion of the member signup form. If you would like to pay by check you can do so at orientation.

If you signed up for an orientation it will be held at our our store at 4824 Baltimore Avenue. 

Please note that, while the new store will be wheelchair accessible, the conference room requires climbing stairs. Please let us know if this impacts your ability to attend.

If you are a returning member I will be in touch with you shortly to re-activate your membership.

Mariposa Food Co-op has both working and non-working member options. Interested in learning more? Click here for information and to get a jump start on setting up your member workshift. http://www.mariposa.coop/why-be-a-working-member/
